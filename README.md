# URSUSdata
These are the three scripts: merge, clean, and analysis related to the paper When Femininity is Irrelevant: Gender Similarities and Racial Differences in Fatal and Nonfatal Police Violence Incidents in California, 2016-2021. The data involves URSUS Use of Force data available here: https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/data

### ABSTRACT
Research consistently finds racial disparities in the frequency and severity of police violence. Police violence research has not interrogated gender to the same effect. We build on interactional theories of “gender irrelevance” to argue that violent incidents between police and civilians cannot be extricated from masculinity’s relevance. However, in contexts when police respond to women as violent, police render women’s femininity as irrelevant. Using 2016-2021 California URSUS Use of Force data and supplementary archival examples, we examine gender and race across fatal and nonfatal police violence incidents. We find that although women comprise only 7.1 percent of the civilians in California URSUS incidents, women are no more or less likely to experience fatal police violence relative to nonfatal violence than men of the same racial group when accounting for police perceptions of civilians being armed. We also find racial differences in perceptions of weapons with lower barriers for fatal violence against Black and Latinx civilians. We argue that when women are in high-conflict violent situations, other statuses such as race and threat become hyper-present beyond women’s femininity, with sometimes fatal consequences.
